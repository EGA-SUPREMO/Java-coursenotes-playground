# Playground 
Those are course notes that I took while I studied using [Pildoras Informaticas's videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU8oAlHdN5BktAXdEVCLUYzvDyqRQJ2lk) around 2015.

Also I would like to add that, this wasn't the only project where I practiced it's lessons:
* https://github.com/EGA-SUPREMO/Text-to-number
* https://github.com/EGA-SUPREMO/symmetrical-thread
* https://github.com/EGA-SUPREMO/minecraft-command-generator-ui
* https://github.com/EGA-SUPREMO/mini-word-processor
* https://github.com/EGA-SUPREMO/java-homework

And while this is the only one with less than 10 commits, it contains more than 30 executable classes that I created over the years.

This a personal repo and it's unlike that you'll find something useful here.

The main purpose of this repo is having some sort of proof that I practiced with Java.
