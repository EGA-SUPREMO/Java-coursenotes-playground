# Playground 
Those are course notes that I took while I studied using [Pildoras Informaticas's videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU8oAlHdN5BktAXdEVCLUYzvDyqRQJ2lk) around 2015.

Also I would like to add that, this wasn't the only project where I practiced it's lessons:

* [Java coursenotes playground](https://github.com/EGA-SUPREMO/Java-coursenotes-playground): Utilized as a sandbox environment to experiment with course notes and examples.
* [Java pop-up homework](https://github.com/EGA-SUPREMO/java-homework): A project where you can chose which pop-up you'll get using every combination possible of JOptionPane
* [Text to number](https://github.com/EGA-SUPREMO/Text-to-number): a project to practice text manipulation and conversion of coded messages in Java.
* [Symmetrical thread](https://github.com/EGA-SUPREMO/symmetrical-thread): Created to explore symmetrical threading techniques covered in the course.
* [Minecraft command generator ui](https://github.com/EGA-SUPREMO/minecraft-command-generator-ui): Developed to apply Java GUI concepts learned in the course to create a user-friendly Minecraft command generator.
* [Mini word processor](https://github.com/EGA-SUPREMO/mini-word-processor): Created as a project to reinforce understanding of object-oriented programming principles by implementing a simple word processor in Java.

And while this has few commits, it contains more than 30 executable classes that I created over the years.

This a personal repo and it's unlike that you'll find something useful here.

The main purpose of this repo is having some sort of proof that I practiced with Java.
